# Missing Closing Tags in HTML
This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: missing or misplaced closing tags.  Missing closing tags can cause unexpected rendering issues and make your HTML difficult to maintain. The `bug.html` file shows the error, and `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

## Bug
The `bug.html` file contains a paragraph element (`&lt;p&gt;`) without a closing tag, and another element which is misplaced. This will cause unexpected rendering behavior in browsers. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file corrects the error by adding the missing closing tag for the paragraph (`&lt;/p&gt;`). Ensure your HTML has properly nested and closed tags for consistent rendering and easier debugging.
